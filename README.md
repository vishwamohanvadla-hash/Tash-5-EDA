# Task-5-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). The project explores survival patterns by gender, passenger class, age, and fare, with visualizations and summary insights.
# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between passenger features and survival outcomes.  
The analysis is done using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** in a Jupyter Notebook.
